# time-series-analysis-copper-price

[This project](time-series-analysis-copper-price.ipynb) focuses on forecasting copper prices using time series analysis and machine learning models. Key steps included testing stationarity with the Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test and removing trends by differencing. Seasonality was analyzed via decomposition and confirmed to have minimal influence using Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots.

Four models were implemented:

1. Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing): Evaluated residuals for normality and no autocorrelation (Ljung-Box test).
2. Autoregression (AR): Used significant lags identified through Partial Autocorrelation of the differenced series.
3. ARIMA: Combined AR and MA for integrated time series, with significant lags chosen via Autocorrelation.
4. ARIMAX: Extended ARIMA by incorporating Fourier Series as exogenous features for Harmonic Regression.
